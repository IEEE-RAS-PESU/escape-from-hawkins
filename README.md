## Notes for the event organizers and student mentors -

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Problem statements for the Escape from Hawkins stream of IEEE RAS PESU's treasure hunt (Summer, 2022).

The participants are to be instructed to `pip install opencv-python` and `pip install pyserial` on their environment.

Refer to `problemStatements.pdf` for a general overview of the statements as well as their associated resources as contained in this repository.

Each statement directory's `README.md` will indicate which files should be shared with the participants.

**NO FILE TITLED `main.py` IS TO BE SHARED WITH THE PARTICIPANTS. THEY ARE THE EXPECTED ANSWERS TO THE PROBLEM STATEMENTS AND HAVE BEEN COMMITTED FOR EVALUATION PURPOSES**

## Introductory message for the participants - 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alright guys, welcome to the Escape from Hawkins (EFH) Treasure Hunt!

Website Link : https://ieee-ras-pesu.github.io/website/assets/html/hawkins.html

Procedure for event progression :

- Participants will be required to access the link above, input their team name and the code *'ps1'* to access the first problem statement and it's attached resources.
- Upon completion of the statement, they will be required to send exactly one video demonstrating the output to the student mentors (<@Sriram & @Rashmi>) via whatsapp. They will verify it and will provide the access code for the next problem statement. This will continue for all five problem statements.
- A major intent of this event is to test you on your error resolution skills so only contact the student mentors for assistance if you're absolutely sure that any hitches in your program execution are due to circumstantial reasons out of your control.
- Do not send your source code or any other supporting files for the submission unless specifically requested for. Some of the problem statements may require you to change your environment's python/OpenCV version for successful execution and hence won't be cross compatible across systems.
- We have a webhook operating on the backend to update us on who has completed which statement and at what time, so only use the team name you've given for PS1 for all the following problem statements (case-sensitive). submissions made under erroneous team names won't be considered for the final after-event evaluation.
- Only one team member should submit a code on the website at a time. Intentional multiple accesses will be frowned upon.
- Once you've submitted the fifth problem statement, pat yourself on the back, sit back and relax. We will announce the winners in due time and make all our decisions to break any ties transparent to you.

Aside from the rules mentioned above, it's a free for all. Any resource available on the internet can be solicited for assistance. 
All that matters to us in terms of evaluation are your demo videos and the time of code input on the website.

Post any futher questions regarding the event procedure on this group to extend the benefit of the answers to all the participants.

After completion of the EFH and announcement of our results, we will make our code base on GitHub public so that you can check your answers.

The submission page, webhooks and backend interfaces were designed by <@Rohan> to ensure that all support activities could be as streamlined as possible so that you guys can focus solely on solving the problem statements. A huge encore to him <clap emoji>
These tools have been sufficiently well tested and we're confident that you won't run into any errors, but on the off chance that you need any technical support, contact @Rohan.

*This hunt is not going to be easy. It's more of a survival contest than a race to win.*
Although, we will be very impressed if you complete all five problem statements before the *deadline tomorrow - Sunday, 12th of June 2022 @ 1800 HRS.* 

You may begin now. May the fittest team survive to the end.

All the very best to everyone!
