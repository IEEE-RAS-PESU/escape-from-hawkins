Imagine an exceedingly deadly scenario where the Mind Flayer actually uses the Flayed as normally functioning spies to reccy the surroundings in a human dominated area before attacking.
Being unfamiliar with the way we've constructed out surroundings and having a total lack of empathy, the Mind Flayer needs to teach it's drones to react appropriately to avoid accidental deaths of other humans rather than coldly murdering them in broad daylight and moving on as if nothing happened.

Write an algorithm to help a Flayed human see and detect when a pedestrian is crossing a lane and when he's on the edge.
