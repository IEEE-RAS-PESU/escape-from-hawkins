Let's say you ran into a Flayed. Now, unless the Mind Flayer explicitly gives an instruction to said Flayed to behave in a hostile manner to you, it's just going to stand there giving you a menacing stare.
Simulate this system by writing a face tracking algorithm with an accompanying arduino script to control two motors mounted to the camera (one per dimension of movement).
The camera must move in such a way that the camera tracks the face as it moves (as seen in the test video).
Create a tinkercad project to simulate the physical build.
